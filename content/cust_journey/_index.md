Meet Jim, a procurement lead at ACME Inc. Jim is responsible to negotiate the pricing with various technology partners, review the terms and conditions, accept the offers and make the product available to the business user. Let us see what Jim has to do to be sucessful in his job.

1. Negotiate a custom pricing with partner and have them generate a Private offer in AWS Marketplace [Not is scope for this workshop].
2. Review the private offer and accept it.
3. Configure the Private Marketplace.
4. Add the product associated with the private offer in to Private Marketplace.
5. Subscribe to the product.
5. Share the grants for this product with remaining accounts in the organization.
6. Accept and grant from one of the child accounts.
7. Access the product from the child account.


Let us dive deep in to each individual task step-by-step. As mentioned earlier, creating a private offer is not part of this workshop. You may watch the video demonstration of the same at [Private offer end to end demo](https://amazon.awsapps.com/workdocs/index.html#/document/0ab2f7879b6679d9cd7742b866f416610e1fd12c3feeb1cbbe57d8922f3eac7d).
